    "# Lab Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For positioning there is a wide array of applications of GNSS receivers. In this set of labs we will explore a few of them. In the first lab we will establish a **control point**. The use of control points is that they may be used to transform the coordinates of a local survey to georeferenced coordinates. Traditional optical surveys are **tied** in to control i.e., by including at least two control points the survey is associated to a reference frame. Modern GNSS surveys only require at least one control station. Tying the survey data in to the reference frame is then achieved by concurrently acquiring data at the control station and at the survey site; the differences between the observations may then be used to get accurate WGS84 referenced results for the survey site. This positioning mode is known as Differential GPS (DGPS) if we use the GPS code to measure the pseudo-ranges, or Real Time Kinematic GPS if we observe the phase of the signals. The receiver at the control station is then known as **base station**\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be that this is not the reference frame in which the data products are supposed to be delivered, but if there is a known transformation between the reference frames the reference frame in which the control is established may be considered an intermediate reference frame. A common example of this is where we are to deliver our products with respect to some client defined geodetic datum e.g., NAD83 and use GPS to collect the required data. It is then necessary to do a transformation of the data from WGS84 to NAD83.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) A static survey of a point that will act as our control station\n",
    "- 2) Create a base station and confirm that we are getting differential corrections\n",
    "- 3) Do a hybrid survey in which we will establish control for a total station survey by:\n",
    "    - a) Using the base station to establish two position with a rover\n",
    "    - b) Observe the 2 rover locations using a robotic total station\n",
    "    - c) Survey a few points with the robotic total station establishing the geo-referenced locations of some features of interest\n",
    "    \n",
    "Each of the steps will be done in a different lab period\n"

    "# 1 Creation of a Reference Point\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish control for the remainder of the lab we will have to establish **survey control** that is we have to establish the coordinates of a point in the reference frame that we will be doing our survey in. Ideally we will also establish the coordinates of that point in the coordinate system that we will deliver our data products in.\n",
    "\n",
    "in our case we want to deliver data with reference to NAD83(2010), that is we want to do a survey whose coordinates are referenced to the epoch Jan 1, 2010 realization of the North American Datum of 1983. We want to have the ability to deliver these data either as curvilinear geodetic latitudes and longitudes, or as UTM coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to establish this control - the conceptually simplest of which is to set up a receiver over an already known control point and another over the newly established control point. If we then make GNSS observations for a long enough period of time to reduce the noise and deal with any possible drift in the data we can use the results to establish the new control point with WGS84 coordinates. There are, however, a number of drawbacks to this. Among other negatives it necessitates careful QA/QC of the data collected at the control point, it may be that there is no suitable control point close by, and it makes that you need to dedicate two GNSS receivers to the establishment of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will make use of the fact that in the USA, as in many other nations, there are Continuously Operating Reference Systems (CORS) that give access to the National Spatial Reference Systems (NSRS), which is the reference frame implementing the official federal government reference frames."

Though the receivers are owned and operated the network is maintained by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS), an office of NOAA. The managing role of the NGS is then to tie the CORS into the NSRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a receiver to be accepted into the CORS network a strict set of standards and specifications must be met, allowing for high quality monitoring of the movements of the location at which the receivers are located. However, since we know exactly where these stations are located with respect to NAD83(2010) and how they have moved since then with respect to that datum we may use the data collected at these stations as differential correctors. Therefore it may be said that the NOAA CORS network supports high accuracy 3D positioning.\n",

    "\n",
    "To take full advantage of CORS networks it is beneficial to provide access to the data *and* services through web portals. A specifically useful task that the the manager of a CORS network can fulfill is to provide a positioning service. That is to allow users to upload data files collected with roving GNSS receivers and return post processed kinematic positions making use of the CORS receiver data as base station data. Such a service can theoretically be provided for both dynamic as well as static roving receivers. Currently the NGS provides such positioning service for static receivers:the Online Positioning User Service (OPUS)\n",
    "\n",
    "OPUS therefore gives access to the National Spatial Reference System by taking GNSS observations and converting them to NAD83 Positions, as well as Geoid18 orthometric heights. Other data that are provided are current epoch International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) coordinates, UTM coordinates, State Plate Coordinates and a US National Grid designator. A class will be dedicated to the topic of NGS OPUS.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major benefit of using OPUS is that the accuracy of the data will be consistent with other NSRS users and a high level of confidence may be placed on the solutions. On a typical day well over a 1000 data sets are submitted to this service, therefore the NGS has gained much experience in dealing with a wide variety of GNSS data set qualities and issues.\n",
