    "In this step you will determine the locations of the satellites in their orbits at the time of observation. These locations are determined in Earth Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian coordinates, and are known as ephemeris. We will only touch on orbit mechanics, but it is important that you get familiar with the fact that ephemeris are made available only for given epochs.\n",

    "- “Final” precise ephemerides (12 day latency); \n",

    "- “UltraRapid” ephemerides (6 hour latency for observed,  & 24 hour predictions):\n",

However, the names for the files are correct, but not necessarily housed in that location anymore - it is up to you to find a location on the internet to download the files (for some depositories you may have to create an account)\n",

    "\n",
    "The P in the first column identifies the record as a “Position” record (some SP3 files also contain V for velocity records as well).   The second column is the official identifier for each satellite – its Pseudo Random Noise code number (PRN code), which can take values between 1 and 32.  Use this identifier throughout the following steps, to keep track of which satellite is which.\n",
    "These coordinates are in units of km.  Convert them to m for use in the following steps.\n",
    "Note that these satellites are distributed evenly around the earth, and for any location, the majority will be below the horizon at any particular time.  We are going to have to figure out which satellites (at our chosen epoch) are above and below the horizon for our virtual GNSS location.  We will do this in Step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in step 2 we will use a parser that will read the data in the ephemeris files. At this instant I want you to just download the data and somehow convert the positions to units of meters.\n",

    "## 1.3.0 CLOCK BIAS\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the places that can get confusing when dealing with GNSS systems. GNSS works by measuring the time interval between the transmission of a signal at a GNSS `Satellite Vehicle` (**SV**) and reception of that signal at a GNSS receiver. The way this time interval is determined is by determining the clock difference between time of arrival and time of departure. The problem is that inherently you need two clocks for this process: 1) the clock on the satellite for the time of departure and, 2) the clock on the receiver for the time of arrival. \n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental problem is that the clocks need to be synchronized. The satellite clocks are atomic clocks and thus extremely precise, furthermore they are monitored and estimates of their time errors are included in the ephemeris data, so that in post processing the time of departure may be even better quantified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is then the clocks in the receiver, atomic clocks are extremely expensive and small time errors lead to big errors. Remember that EM signals travel at the speed of light $c$ and the distance traversed per time unit is given by $c*t$, thus 1 ms time error leads to a 300km range error! How come then can we achieve positioning accuracy on the order of meters with the GNSS receivers built in to our cell phones?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the question posed above lies in the fact that a simple crystal oscillator may have a large time offset from the GNSS time base, however during the time that it takes to make the satellite observations needed to position ourselves the clock will drift a negligible amount. That is: we can assume that the receiver clock error will be the same for all the observations made to the various satellites for an epoch. Thus, the receiver clock errors are a `clock bias` for each positioning epoch. As the timing bias is assumed to be the same for all GNSS satellites it can be modeled by adding (or subtracting) a constant from the geometric distances.  An estimate for this bias value is recovered by adding a constant bias term as a fourth unknown (together with the 3 dimensional receiver coordinates) in the `least squares fix` solution (you will learn what that is as part of this exercise).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a timing bias ∆t (less than 0.001 second), and compute how far the GNSS signal would travel during that interval (∆t * 299792458, the speed of light).  For example, a clock bias of 3.3356 microseconds (0.0000033356 seconds) is equivalent to a distance bias of almost 1000 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add (or subtract) a common bias to all measurements to represent the clock bias parameter \"∆t\" which will be solved for in Steps 9 and 10.  It should not matter what value is selected for this common bias, large or small, positive or negative, since it should be completely recovered by the least squares fix.\n",

    "GNSS measurements are basically time-of-propagation measurements, multiplied by the vacuum speed of radio waves to obtain a satellite-to-receiver distance.  One of the systematic uncertainties affecting these distance measurements is tropospheric delay (TD).  Tropospheric errors on GNSS signals occur because radio waves travel slower through the troposphere than through a vacuum, so distances are too long if they are calculated ignoring this delay.  \n",
    "Tropospheric delay is added to the vacuum speed distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tropospheric delay is an example of a systematic uncertainty.  It increases as the length of the path of the satellite signal through the troposphere increases.  This length increases as the elevation decreases from the shortest path, which occurs when the satellite is overhead ($elevation = 90°$) to when the satellite is on the horizon ($elevation = 0°$). \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple function which increases from a minimum value of 1 at $elevation = 90°$, to a value which increases beyond all limits at $elevation = 0°$ is is $TD = 1 / sin(elevation)$.  Models for $TD$ are often based upon a variation of this function.  For a typical marine climate, it is estimated that the zenith tropospheric delay (usually denoted as $k$) is $2.31 m$.  Hence we scale the model as $TD = k / sin(elevation)$.  This model explodes as the elevation approaches zero, and this is not what is observed in practice.  So some kind of modification is required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two approaches have been taken:\n",
    "Option 1:  Use $TD = k\\min(B, 1/\\sin(\\theta))$, where $\\theta$ is the elevation.  Using this option, when $1 / \\sin(\\theta)$ grows larger than the value of $B$, the model ignores the $\\sin$ function, and limits the $TD = kB$.  For example if $b = 10$, it cuts in when elevation drops below about $5.75°$; $b = 20$ cuts in at elevation $2.85°$; $b = 30$ cuts in at elevation $1.95°$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not use the above option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2:  Use $TD = k / \\sin(\\sqrt{\\theta^2 + C^2})$ where $C$ is a bias angle.  Using this option, when the elevation drops close to zero, the $sin$ function is prevented from exploding by the addition of $C$ to its argument.  This model has been used as far back as 1971 with $k = 2.31 m$, and $c = 2.5°$ for the dry troposphere; and $k = 0.20$ and $C = 1.5°$ for the wet (water vapor content of the) troposphere.  This model (officially the simplified Hopfield model) has been shown to agree with the best (very complex) tropospheric delay models to within $5 cm$ for $\\theta > 10°$ and within $20 cm$ for $\\theta > 3°$. The value for $C$ should be smaller than $10°$ and submitted in ***radians***.\n",

    "Select an offset from the (true) receiver position, in Cartesian coordinates, to be used as an initial estimate for the least squares position fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion:\n",
    "Since a GNSS receiver does not know (exactly) where it is BEFORE computing a fix, we would be cheating if we used the “true” values for the receiver coordinates in the steps that follow.  Only approximate values for the receiver coordinates would be known when a GNSS receiver starts a position fix computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add or subtract 1000 m to each of the three “true” Virtual GNSS Receiver coordinates that we will determine in Step 2.  Using a round number like 1000 m makes it easy to track the convergence to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How wrong do you think these initial estimates can be, and still have the least squares solution converge to the correct value?  At the end of the term test this: start with offsets of 1000 m in each coordinate, proceed through Steps 8 to 10, and return and increase the offsets in increments of 1000 m until the solution no longer converges.  HINT: one criterion controlling convergence is whether the actual and approximate locations see roughly the same GNSS satellite configuration.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "In a real GNSS receiver, the initial values for the receiver coordinates would be the previous fix position.  Normally this is very close to the new position, if the receiver operates continuously, producing a new fix position every second. I once turned my handheld receiver off in Singapore, and back on again in North America.  How you think the receiver chose its own initial approximate coordinates in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to consider all four unknown parameters to be solved for (x_rx, y_rx, z_rx and ∆t) as the “solution vector”, and treat them the same throughout the following steps.  This avoids the common problem of dealing inappropriately with ∆t during the iterations.  An appropriate initial estimate for ∆t is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable:\n",
    "Shifts to be applied to Virtual GNSS Receiver Cartesian coordinates, and clock offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial receiver coordinate estimate: 1000 m shift in each coordinate, away from true (known) values\n",
    "Initial clock offset estimate: zero\n",
