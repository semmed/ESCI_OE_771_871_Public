    "Keplerian motion is the motion of **satellites** in their orbits. Satellites can be artificial and placed in an orbit or can be celestial. In both cases satellite motion is the motion of one object around another and is strongly dependent on the gravitational attraction between them. Johannes Kepler developed three laws of planetary motion around the sun in the early 17th century. At the end of the 17th century Newton showed that Kepler's laws are consistent with the law of universal gravitation and laws of motion. This makes that the Kepler's laws may be used to model satellite orbital motion with sufficient accuracy to determine satellite positions. Note that for timing relativistic effects come into play, which is a subject outside the scope of this course.\n",

    "The first two of Kepler's laws may be combined to calculate the position of satellites for a given epoch. The combination of the first two laws creates Kepler's equation that allows the position determination of the satellite in polar coordinates with their origin at the center of the body that they orbit. In the case of **GPS** that is the center of the reference frame defined by **WGS84**. The position of the satellite is then a function of time since being in a given location of the orbit. The reference used by Kepler's laws is the **perigee**, that is the location at which the satellite is closest to earth. The angle $\\nu$ describing the position is known as the **true anomaly** $\\nu$ and is the angle from the perigee increasing in the direction of the satellite motion.\n",

    "We can then find the `ECEF` coordinates by transforming the polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates by relating the orbit parameters to the WGS84 system. These steps are divided in a number of smaller steps. All of these steps are implemented in the `gnss.get_single_epoch_ephemeris_from_gps_nav()` method. Note that the implementation of the method is based on the paper [Computing satellite velocity using the broadcast ephemeris](../Documentation/Remondi2004_Article_ComputingSatelliteVelocityUsin.pdf) by Ben Remondi(2004). In the mean time an improved modeling method has been published which is finding general acceptance; This method is found in the paper [Computing GPS Satellite Velocity and Acceleration from the Broadcast Navigation Message](../Documentation/GPS-SV-velocity-and-acceleration.pdf) by Thompson, et al. (2019) - if you feel up to it you may implement this version instead. \n",

The return data `eph` consist of matrix with the number of rows matching the number of satellites for which data are available. The data used in this step are from the GPS broadcast ephemeris, that is the data that the GPS svs transmit while in orbit. Given that we are dealing with a virtual receiver we do not have the capability to actually receive these data. Fortunately these data are however stored at the various gnss data centers around the world, including the NASA repository used for this assignment. The `GNSS.add_next_epoch_ephemeris()` automatically retrieves these data for GPS and stores them in a `RINEX_nav` object. The `RINEX_nav` class was specifically created to be able to read and hold the broadcast ephemeris data that is disseminated in the *Receiver Independent Exchange Format* (**RINEX**) navigation files. In case of GPS broadcast data these are the Keplerian elements needed to calculate the position of the svs. Much like the precise ephemeris files you analyzed in step 2 the data is organized in epochs and given for each PRN (You will find a RINEX format description in the documentation). You can determine the number of satellites by counting the PRN identifiers for the `RINEX_nav` object `gps_nav` holding the data.\n",
