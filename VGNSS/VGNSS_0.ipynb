    "- The first learning objective is to deepen your understanding of geodesy, coordinate systems, coordinate transformations, and GNSS positioning.  This objective is achieved by working through what a GNSS receiver actually does (in the simplest possible case).  The basic premise of this practical exercise is that each student becomes a “virtual GNSS receiver” performing (over many weeks of hard work) all the functions, which any GNSS receiver does (in milliseconds).\n",
    "- The second learning objective is to provide a relevant vehicle to be used to develop your programming skills.  This practical exercise requires that you program all the mathematical steps required to compute a single-epoch, single-receiver GNSS fix position.  \n",
    "- The third learning objective is to develop your debugging skills.  Learning a programming language can be frustrating.  Small errors in coding can be hard to detect.  This practical exercise provides three facilities to assist the beginning programmer to develop skill in detecting and correcting such small coding errors.  The first facility is a worked example that can be used to check your results against known answers.  The second facility is expert advice  from fellow students through Piazza, and  the third by email assistance from the instructor (more about this below).\n"

    "\n",
    "That does not mean you cannot work together, developing the algorithms and code required to do the work.  In fact, I encourage such a group approach.  However, each student will prepare their own code, compute their own results, and should satisfy himself or herself that they *comprehend* what they have and done and are able to individually *apply* what they have done for each step in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with notebooks – in these templates precise instructions are included for the deliverable variables. You will submit your completed code based on the notebook. I will then evaluate your results by running my own code and evaluating the differences with your variables. This means that some of the variables are considered the deliverables and that they need to be formatted exactly as indicated in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though you are provided a notebook it is still important to remember to set up your computations so they can easily be repeated by simply changing input values. You should NOT create dummy variables that contain the same information as the deliverables – this is confusing and leads to messy code that is very hard to evaluate and debug."
