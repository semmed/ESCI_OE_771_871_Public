    "GNSS use carrier frequencies in the L band i.e., they are microwave signals and thus GNSS are line of sight systems. Assuming they are functioning correctly and no extreme environmental events are occurring this means that satellites are visible when they are above the horizon. Since our ephemerides are given with respect to an ECEF reference frame with an ‘up’ axis aligned to the Earth’s rotation axis we cannot simply glean whether a satellite is visible from its coordinates. However, determining the visibility of a satellite is a simple geometric problem with the right choice of reference system, namely one aligned to the horizon plane at the location of the GNSS receiver, such systems are known as topocentric systems and, just like geocentric systems, come in polar and Cartesian form.\n",
